This is a fork of DFC-Incubator's version of pam-cas-reloaded
intended to be used in student's lab at Departamento de Ingenieria Telematica - ETSIT UPM

Several changes are done to original code in order to:
- Adapt to CAS-UPM authentication server issues
- Retrieve and handle extra parameters from CAS server:
  * Username ( login name and home directory )
  * Gecos ( user full name for informational purposes )
  * User role ( Student, teacher, staff, to evaluate group id )
  * School adscription ( to reject users outside ETSIT-UPM )
  * DNI ( to extract user id from these unique identifier )
- Check for presence of user's /home directory, if not exists, create with evaluated uid and gid
- On failure, let's play next pam module ( internal DIT-Ldap server ) to check authentication
  for additional users ( admin, tests and guest accounts )

See conf/common-auth to see sample pam config for Dit-UPM labs

--------- Original README follows ----------
The aim of the module is to provide authentication against the Yale CAS Authentication service,
both by a user+password and a user+ticket combination, so it can be used for direct
as well as proxied authentication.

Usage:

1. make
2. make install
3. cp conf/pam_cas.conf /etc/pam_cas.conf
4. edit /etc/pam_cas.conf
5. edit /etc/pam.d/.... (ssh/dovecot/etc)
6. change to something like:

auth 	   sufficient 	pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth	   sufficient	pam_cas.so use_first_pass
auth	   required	pam_deny.so

Test! (Watch the syslog for authentication attempts)

Changelog:

- 26/Jan/2012: v0.3 Configuration file support added
- 25/Jan/2012: v0.2 CAS full user+pass combo login, and serviceValidate implemented
- 25/Jan/2012: v0.1 Initial code

Credits:
- Config file loading is done by the inih simple C parser (http://code.google.com/p/inih/)
- CAS/PAM code was inspired by the Yale pam_cas module as well as the french esup-portail.org's version.
